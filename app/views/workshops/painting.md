# Painting

![Peter painting](/assets/workshops/painting.jpg)

Painting workshops are held twice a day---once for younger children and once for older children and adults. Attendants will have the oportunity to paint with primary and secondary acrylic colors on a canvas and to continuously develop their paintings. The motif can emerge spontaneously (from the color itself) or it can be predetermined, it depends solely on personal preference.

Even though we will supply painting easels, palletes, colors and different canvas formats, attendants can also bring their own equipment for other artistic techniques. We will observe the paintings each day to help attendants develop new possibilities for their paintings. After the first week attendants should come up with a general idea about the style, motif and feel of their paintings. During the last few days, they can submit their paintings to the gallery for everyone to enjoy.
