  -# ## How to get there?

  -# You can take a ferry from Zadar which will only take about two hours. You may check for [ferry schedules](http://www.jadrolinija.hr/pdfs/401.2011.zima.hr.pdf) to avoid any inconvenience (Zadar -- Premuda/Mali Lo≈°inj) . You can also take a catamaran (Miatours -- you can check the schedule [here](http://www.miatours.hr/index-en.htm)) which is faster, but no cars or bikes are allowed. It is desirable to buy a ticket for ferry and catamaran in advance, and if you are interested in this possibility, please contact the organizers.

    # Workshops

    Workshops are the main part of the camp, they make your stay here very different from your regular vacation! They vary from year to year, but there are ones which are more or less constant and they are suitable for both children and parents: *yoga*, *painting*, *circus* (juggling, silk, performances and motions, acrobalance, games...) and *singing*. If you have an idea for a new workshop or even want to lead one, please, [let us know](mailto:helena.ivetic@waldorfcamp.net)! We all want to learn and have fun :)
