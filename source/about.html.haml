  -# ## How to get there?

  -# You can take a ferry from Zadar which will only take about two hours. You may check for [ferry schedules](http://www.jadrolinija.hr/pdfs/401.2011.zima.hr.pdf) to avoid any inconvenience (Zadar -- Premuda/Mali Lo≈°inj) . You can also take a catamaran (Miatours -- you can check the schedule [here](http://www.miatours.hr/index-en.htm)) which is faster, but no cars or bikes are allowed. It is desirable to buy a ticket for ferry and catamaran in advance, and if you are interested in this possibility, please contact the organizers.
